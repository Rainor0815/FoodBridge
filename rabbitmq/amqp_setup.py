    # - "topic" for pattern-based routing (e.g., "order.*")
    # - "direct" for exact routing (e.g., "order.created")
    # - "fanout" for broadcasting (no routing key)
    #
    # Example for a topic exchange:
    # create_exchange(channel, "topic_exchange", "topic")  # Topic exchange for routing

    # add create_exchange() here
    
    # STEP 2: Declare the Queue
    # Choose a queue name and routing key based on your use case:
    #
    # Example for Topic Exchange:
    # create_queue(channel, "topic_exchange", "order_queue", "order.*")
    #
    # Example for Fanout Exchange (no routing key):
    # create_queue(channel, "fanout_exchange", "broadcast_queue", "")
    #
    # Example for Direct Exchange:
    # create_queue(channel, "direct_exchange", "specific_order_queue", "order.created")

    # add create_queue() here


    # STEP 3: Add code in your service to interact with RabbitMQ (refer to README for consuming and publishing messages)
