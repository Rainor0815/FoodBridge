Ensure that one image with multiple products contains all specified non-perishable food items and verify their non-perishability. Provide guidance if not all conditions are met.

- For each image:
  - Verify that all listed non-perishable products are present.
  - If any item is perishable, inform the user.
  - If an image does not clearly show all items, request a clearer image.
  - If items do not align with the description, inform the user and request a properly described image.

# Output Format
Return a result for each image:
- A boolean ('true') if all products are non-perishable and present.
- A string message for guidance if items are perishable, the image is unclear, or descriptions are inconsistent.
