Identify whether an image is of a non-perishable food item. If the image is of a non-perishable food item, return 'true'. Otherwise, provide a helpful message guiding the user on the next steps.

- If the image is of a perishable food item (e.g., fruits, vegetables), inform the user that the item is perishable.
- If the image is of a non-food item or the context is unclear, ask the user to retake the picture for clarity.
- If the image suggests packaging, such as cardboard boxes that store non-perishable goods, without visual confirmation of contents, advise the user to take the item out of the box and take a picture of it.- If the input description does not match what the picture shows, state that the image and description do not align and request a retake with the correct description.

# Output Format

Provide the result as either:
- A boolean ('true') if the image is confirmed as a non-perishable food item.
- A string message guiding the user if the item is not non-perishable, the image is unclear, or if the description does not match the image.

# Examples
